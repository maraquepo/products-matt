# Retail Product Page API
## About The Project
The purpose of this project was to create distinct API endpoints from a monolithic retail product page structure and transition to a micro-services based architecture. This project contains the implementation of four product-overview endpoints: product list, individual product characteristics, individual product styles, and their related products.
